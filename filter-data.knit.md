## The `WHERE` clause

## Operators 

### Comparison operators 


### Logical operators 

Logical operators enable users to combine multiple boolean expressions.  

Binary operators `AND` and `OR`

Unary operator `NOT`


Be mindful of order of operators: `NOT` (first), `AND` (second), `OR` (third). One workaround is to use parenthesis `()` to indicate order.
