# Preface {-}


This document covers essential SQL skills for data manipulation, with a focus on DQL (Data Query Language, always starts with `SELECT`). Quries will typically be interpreted with the `PostgreSQL` dialect in `knitr`'s `sql` engine. I include `dplyr` code when there could be some interesting comparison between these two tools. 


Before each chapter, the following command is automatically evaluated:  


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(DBI)

con <- dbConnect(dbDriver('PostgreSQL'), # SQL engine
                 dbname = dbname, # database name
                 host = "localhost", # either localhost or a database url
                 port = 5432, # the defualt port
                 user = user, # username
                 password = password) # password
```

By default, `SELECT` queries will display the first 10 records of their results within the document, in other words `LIMIT 10` is appended to each query, this is controlled via `knitr::opts_knit$set(sql.max.print = )`.
