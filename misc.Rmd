# Subqueries 

We have encountered subqueries where we are interested the difference between one's salary and the highest salary in the `employees` table. 

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT salary - 
  (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)
  AS difference
FROM employees
```


A subquery is nested inside another query. Typically, itâ€™s used for a
calculation or logical test that provides a value or set of data to be passed
into the main portion of the query. Its syntax is not unusual: we just
enclose the subquery in parentheses and use it where needed. For
example, we can write a subquery that returns multiple rows and treat the results as a table in the FROM clause of the main query. 

Or we can create a
scalar subquery that returns a single value and use it as part of an expression
to filter rows via WHERE , IN , and HAVING clauses. These are the most common
uses of subqueries.

Adding a subquery to a `WHERE` clause can be useful in query statements
other than SELECT .

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary >= (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
```
