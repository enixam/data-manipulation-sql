# Simple Queries


## `SELECT`

## Data Types 






## The `WITH` Clause

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-with-clause/  

```{sql connection=con, eval = FALSE}
WITH inventory_subset AS (
  SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE shop != 'Dicey'
)
SELECT * FROM inventory_subset
```





Fundamentally, the definition of a view is saved in the database and can be reused by any query, whereas a `WITH` clause (or Common Table Expression, or CTE) is tied to one specific query and can only be reused by copying. Otherwise, they will be substantially the same
