## Data Types


## DDL


- `CREATE`: to create objects (table or database) in RDBMS

- `ALTER`: alters the structure of database

- `DROP`: delete objects from database

- `RENAME`: rename an objects


### Creating Tables 

```sql
CREATE TABLE {table_name} (
{column_name_1} {data_type_1} {column_constraint_1},
{column_name_2} {data_type_2} {column_constraint_2},
{column_name_3} {data_type_3} {column_constraint_3},
â€¦
{column_name_last} {data_type_last} {column_constraint_last},
)
```

Common data types are: 


The available constraints in SQL are:

`NOT NULL`: This constraint tells that we cannot store a null value in a column. That is, if a column is specified as NOT NULL then we will not be able to store null in this particular column any more.

`UNIQUE`: This constraint when specified with a column, tells that all the values in the column must be unique. That is, the values in any row of a column must not be repeated.

`PRIMARY KEY`: A primary key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a table. And this constraint is used to specify a field in a table as primary key.

`FOREIGN KEY`: A Foreign key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as Foreign key.

`CHECK`: This constraint helps to validate the values of a column to meet a particular condition. That is, it helps to ensure that the value stored in a column meets a specific condition.

`DEFAULT`: This constraint specifies a default value for the column when no value is specified by the user.



## Dropping and Updating Tables 

`DROP TABLE <name>` is used to delete a table. What is often done is updating an old table. This requires dropping the old table if it exists, and create a new one.  

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <name>;
CREATE TABLE <name> as ...
```

Note the semicolon behind `name`. 



## DML


- `INSERT`: insert data into a table

- `UPDATE`: update existing data within a table

- `DELETE`: deletes all records from a table, space 

Some would argue that `SELECT` should fall into the DML category. However, I think it is to our best advantage to make `SELECT` a standalone type of statements, DQL (database query language). Later chapters of this document is really focused on syntax and functions that can make the most of DQL. 

### Inserting Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2 , column3,..) 
VALUES
  (value1, value2, value3, ...),
  (value1, value2, value3, ...),
  ...;
```




## Creating Views 

### Deleting Views

### Updating Views

## Queries 

Queries or DQL in SQL starts with `SELECT`




### Order of Execution

### The `WITH` Clause

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-with-clause/  

```{sql connection=con, eval = FALSE}
WITH inventory_subset AS (
  SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE shop != 'Dicey'
)
SELECT * FROM inventory_subset
```





Fundamentally, the definition of a view is saved in the database and can be reused by any query, whereas a `WITH` clause (or Common Table Expression, or CTE) is tied to one specific query and can only be reused by copying. Otherwise, they will be substantially the same
