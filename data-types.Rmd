# Data types 

## Converting data types 

To change the data type of a column, we simply need to use the `column::datatype` format,
where column is the column name, and data type is the data type you want to change the
column to.

`::`

`CAST`

## Type-specific operations

### Date and time 

 To see your current settings, you can use the following command:

```{sql connection=con}
SHOW DateStyle
```



```{sql connection=con}
SET DateStyle='ISO, MDY';
```


```{sql connection=con}
SELECT current_date, current_timestamp, NOW()
```


```{sql connection=con}
SELECT current_date,
  EXTRACT(year FROM current_date) AS year,
  EXTRACT(month FROM current_date) AS month,
  EXTRACT(day FROM current_date) AS day
```
